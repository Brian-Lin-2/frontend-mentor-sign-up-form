## Overview

Designed a basic form with that includes a first name, last name, email, and password.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how <button> and <input> worked in relation to forms.
```html
<form class="signUp">
  <div class="signUp__firstName">
    <input class="input firstName" type="text" placeholder="First Name">
    <img class="signUp__error firstName__iconError hide" src="images/icon-error.svg" alt="">
  </div>
</form>
```

I learned how the event listener 'submit' worked.
```JavaScript
form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {});
```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I would like more practice with forms and JavaScript functions.
